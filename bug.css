The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be errors if you don't follow its syntax precisely. For instance, using an unexpected operator or forgetting spaces around the plus or minus signs can cause unexpected results.  Another common error is nesting `calc()` expressions improperly, which can lead to parsing issues.  Units must also be consistent; mixing units without proper conversion will result in incorrect values.
